# 🔐 Spring Security Application

## 🚀 Introduction

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Spring Security** in a Spring Boot application. The focus is on a role-based access control system where each role can have a combination of permissions, and these roles are then associated with users. This structure allows fine-grained access control over various resources in the application.

## 🛠️ Key Features

### 🗝️ Role-Based Access Control
- **Permissions**: Each resource is protected by specific permissions.
- **Roles**: A role can be a combination of multiple permissions.
- **Users**: Users are assigned roles, which determine their access rights across the application.

### 🧑‍💻 User Management
- Users are stored in a database, with their roles and permissions managed dynamically.
- Authentication is handled via Spring Security, ensuring secure login and session management.

### 🔒 Resource Protection
- All resources are secured based on the permissions assigned to the user's roles.
- Unauthorized access attempts are handled with appropriate error responses, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific resources.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

- **src/main/java**: Contains the main Java code, including configurations, controllers, services, and security setup.
- **src/main/resources**: Contains configuration files such as `application.properties`.
- **pom.xml**: The Maven configuration file, managing dependencies, including Spring Boot and Spring Security.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building the application.
- **Spring Security**: Core security framework used for managing authentication and authorization.
- **Maven**: For dependency management and building the project.
- **Java**: Programming language used for development.

## 🧩 Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BiouiAdnane/SpringSecurity.git
   
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
   cd SpringSecurity

3. **Build the project**:
    ```bash
   mvn clean install

4. **Run the application**:
    ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run

## 🛡️ Security Configuration
The security configuration is handled in the SecurityConfig class, where HTTP security, user roles, and permissions are defined. The application uses a database-backed user store, ensuring persistent and secure user data management.
